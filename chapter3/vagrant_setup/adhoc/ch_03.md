### Vagrant & Ad-Hoc commands

#### Create Multiple Servers in VirtualBox

Multiple servers can be created and setup with the `Vagrantfile`, including
provision for access using secure keys.
The number of servers created will be as per the `inventory` file.

#### Ad-Hoc commands
#### Background Processes

The following runs an ad-hoc ansible command in the background with a time limit,
`-B 3600`, and a polling interval, `-P 0`.

The `-b` flag (--become) sets the user to have elevated privileges
(become root/use sudo).

```
$ ansible -i inventory multi -b -B 3600 -P 0 -a "yum -y update"
```

This command returns the state of the tack asigned to each server including
a job id number.
The `jid` can be used to check the backgrounded job status using
the `async_status` module with the command,

```
ansible -i inventory db -b -m async_status -a "jid=595919959595.3812"
```

Note the `db` group is selected since the job id is unique to the that server.

#### Check logs files

```
ansible -i inventory multi -b -a "tail /var/log/messages"
```

#### Pipes & redirection

Ansibles command module does not handle pipes and redirections, therefore
the `-m shell` modules needs to be used. Generally best practice to not use 
the shell module unless absolutely necessary.

```
ansible -i inventory multi -b -m shell -a "tail /var/log/messages | grep ansible-command | wc -l"
```

#### Cron jobs

The `-m cron` module.

```
ansible -i inventory multi -b -m cron -a "name=some_name hour=4 miniute=30 job=/path/to/script.sh"
```

#### Git repos

```
ansible -i inventory multi -b -m git -a "repo=github_url_goes_here dest=/opt/app update=yes version=1.2.4"
```
