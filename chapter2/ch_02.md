### Vagrant

#### VMs on VirtualBox

```
$ vagrant init geerlingguy/centos7
```
will create the '.vagrant' init file which contains the necessary configurations
to start up a virtual machine in VirtualBox (default).

The vagrant configuration file, `Vagrantfile`, contains the configuration to build
local and cloud virtual machines.

`$ vagrant up` will create and start up the vm on VirtalBox.

`$ vagrant ssh` will access the vm via ssh to the default user.

`$vagrant ssh-config` will report the ssh configuration setup.

#### Playbook

An ansible playbook is a yaml file containing instructions to ansible to run.
The playbook lists the 'hosts' to target, and a set of 'tasks' for ansible to
carry out, and any other parameters the tasks may require.

#### Halt & Delete the VM

`$ vagrant halt` will stop the vm.
`$ vagrant destroy` to halt & delete the virtual machine in one go.


#### A cow aside

The cowsay responses are a nice touch and fun feature but are not conducive
to sane parsing of the output.

To disable the cowsay feature, set the env variable, `export ANSIBLE_NOCOWS=1`.
This env var can be put into the .bashrc file.
