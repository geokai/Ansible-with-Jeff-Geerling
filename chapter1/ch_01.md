## Chapter 1

### Introduction and Overview

Typically installed using pip.

Also installed with a system package manager, pacman, yum, etc.

Check the installation of anisible on your system:

The following command provides the version and additional useful information.

```
$ ansible --version
ansible 2.10.7
    config file = /home/<user>/code/ansible_tut_JGeerling/chapter1/ansible.cfg
    configured module search path = ['/home/<user>/.ansible/plugins/modules', '/usr/share/ansible/plugins/modules']
    ansible python module location = /home/<user>/.local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/ansible
    executable location = /home/<user>/.local/bin/ansible
    python version = 3.9.2 (default, Feb 20 2021, 18:40:11) [GCC 10.2.0]
```


Ansible logs into servers via `ssh`, and requires no software on the target hosts.


#### Inventory

An Inventory file contains the servers to be accessed. Servers can be grouped.

```
$ cat inventory
[servers]
192.168.1.10
```

In this example, the group `[servers]`, contains one server, defined by its ip address.

The ansible command,

```
$ ansible -i inventory servers -m ping -u root
```

will use the inventory file `-i inventory`, targeting the server group `servers`,
implementing the ansible module, `-m ping`, with the server user `-u root`,
in this case, to return a ping response from the server.

```
192.168.1.10 | SUCCESS => {
    "ansible_facts": {
        "discovered_interperater_python": "/usr/bin/python"
    },
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
```

#### Configuration Defaults

Many of ansibles' configuration values can be overridden by way of the `ansible.cfg`
configuration file.

```
[default]
INVENTORY = inventory
```

This will override the 'INVENTORY' variable, negating the need to specify the
inventory file on the command line using `-i inventory`


#### Agentless

Although ansible is 'agentless', as in, it does not require any software to be
installed on the target servers, it does, however, require some version of python
to be installed on the server.
