### Ansible Playbooks

Ansible playbooks are written in yaml. Yaml files can be written in either shorthand
or structured yaml.

The example shown is structured yaml,

```
task:
  - name: Install Apache.
  - yum:
      name:
        - httpd
        - httpd-devel
      state: present
```

This is shorthand yaml,

```
task:
  - name: Install Apache.
    yum: name=httpd state=present
```

#### Jinja2

Jinja2 can be used as a full featured template engine. This works very well with
Ansibles `with-item` objects.
